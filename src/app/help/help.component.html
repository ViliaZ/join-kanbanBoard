        <h2>HOW TO USE JOIN</h2>
    
        <p>JOIN is based on the kanban system, which is frequently used in professional settings, eg to organize software
            development in a team.
    
            To get started, create your own boards and tasks or use the data provided. Note, that "ToDo"-board is fixed and cannot be edited or deleted.
        </p>
        <h3> Quick Start:</h3>
        <p> <span>1</span>Create a new Task.
            Use the form on your Dashboard or the colored Plus-button in the top menu of each site.
            Fill out all required fields.</p>
    
    
        <p><span>2</span>Choose a board, where you would like to save your task. Otherwise, tasks are saved to backlog per default.</p>
    
    
        <p><span>3</span>The backlog stores all your tasks that are ot in progress yet.
            You can filter (search) or sort the backlog tasks by clicking on the sort icon.</p>
        <p><span>4</span>Start working on your task by moving it from backlog to "ToDo" board.
        </p>
        <p><span>5</span>Use drag and drop to move your task between boards. Hover over a task to see edit option and delete option.
            You can edit a task by clicking on it. Tasks can also be pinned to the top of a board (see Pin icon on hover).
        </p>
        <p> Create your own boards, delete or edit them to your requirements.</p>
        <p>Enjoy!</p>
